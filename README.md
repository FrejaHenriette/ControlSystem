# Solution
During the development of this solution I have been experimenting with EF Core and the surrounding functionality to enable EF Core. 
I have been working towards getting a better understanding of how to code in C\# and how to properly setup a project.

The project does not work in its current stage. For it to work I would need to add migration and setup a database.
The task was challenging with limited knowledge of the problem space and of the technologies used.

I hope that you enjoy the read!
